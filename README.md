# hello-world
obligatory project 0 stuff

Hi! My name is Owen. Ignore the odd username, I just didn't feel like using my own name and wanted to draft something new and funny. To clarify though, I only import the pandas in data and not in real life. They're quite cute, but I feel like I'd get arrested for trying to import them. Let's not!

Here's where you'll find stuff I post for projects and other things that I do. Hopefully I don't forget my password afterwards so I can keep using this!
:)

## 'hello world'

Very fancy. I like this template a lot.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. Much easier than the LaTeX stuff I have to use in my math classes.

```markdown
# machine learning is cool
## math is pretty cool too
###### machine learning AND math is a killer combination

```

```markdown
this default list doesn't start at 0 so it's not that cool

1. Numbered
2. List

```

## nice text examples
**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

## look, I can use funny quotes too!

> okay, this is epic

Wow. Pandas are so cool. I wish I could import them for real.
